#The end to the annoying "I was on english layout and not hebrew"

Every hebrew speaker and writer knows how annoying it is to write an entire text - only to find out it was in the wrong keyboard layout

no more, friends :)

Use this script easily with 3 steps:

1. copy the original english text
2. paste it into the textbox 
3. click the translate button

and there you have it

your text was "ressurected", without you writing the entire thing down onec again :)

enjoy!

# UPDATE 2.0 - Added support to hebrew to english layout

I created it so anyone could take english QWERTY layout and adapt it to their native QWERTY language layout
